# Research Resources

A collection of sites, papers and other resources that we hope will be of use if you are beginning to look at academic research.

## Research Discovery

### Citations and References

A citation is an external source of information that is mentioned ('cited') in the body of a paper ('in-text' or 'inline'). Usually, the style of the citation is terse, and may be enclosed in parentheses or square brackets. For example, a citation might look like this: [1] or this: (Kraiser, 2011). However, there are [many citation formats](https://connect.ebsco.com/s/article/Where-can-I-find-formatted-examples-of-different-Citation-styles?language=en_US), and for papers that have been published after passing through a submission process, the format used is usually dictated by the rules for submission of the organization through which the paper was published.

A reference is a more full textual description of an external source, designed to allow the reader to obtain the referenced item as a primary source. References are typically collected in a list in a References or Bibliography section toward the end of the paper. Usually, every reference must have been cited somewhere in the paper, and usually every citation has a corresponding reference. However, there are many reference styles, and, for example in [APA Style](https://apastyle.apa.org/), cited personal correspondence that was private and is not accessible to the reader does not need a corresponding reference. The reference style is typically defined as part of the citation style.

### The Citation Graph

Irrespective of their format, citations and/or references act as directed edges in a vast knowledge graph, known as The Citation Graph. In this context, work A is said to cite work B, if work A contains a citation or reference to paper B. The citation graph is a directed graph, since the act of work A citing work B does not imply that work B cites work A. i.e. citation is an asymmetric relation between works. 

The Citation Graph has been called "[one of humankind's most important intellectual achievements](https://boingboing.net/2018/04/14/open-graphs.html)" (by Dario Taraborelli (@readermeter), the Director of Research at the @Wikimedia Foundation).

### Research Paper Search and Recommendation Sites

There are a number of websites which index, cross-reference and rank research papers. To get the most out of them, create an account and star/like/follow etc. people and papers you have found insightful or helpful. Then the site will recommend related work to you, often with uncanny accuracy! 

Some of the best:

* https://scholar.google.com
* https://www.semanticscholar.org
* http://www.arxiv-sanity.com/
* https://www.researchgate.net/

### Curated Research Discovery and Discussion

* [Papers We Love](https://paperswelove.org/)

* [The Paper Trail](https://www.the-paper-trail.org/)

### Associations and Professional Bodies

* ACM
  * [Preferred Employer Program](https://www.acm.org/membership/preferred-employer) [Current members](https://www.acm.org/membership/preferred-employers-list)
* IEEE
  * Local chapters
* USENIX
  * [Corporate memberships and sponsorships](https://www.usenix.org/supporters)

All of them sponsor and/or run a number of conferences on different areas of computer science.

### Conference Tracking Sites

Deadlines for submission and registration. Rankings, based on different measures of 'impact'.

## Reading and Evaluating Research

### How to Read a Paper

* Will add multiple articles and papers on the subject.

### Known Dangers and Biases (aka Here Be Dragons)

* Mistaking correlation for causality
  * [Chocolate Consumption, Cognitive Function,
and Nobel Laureates](http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/courses/bio621/misc/Chocolate%20consumption%20cognitive%20function%20and%20nobel%20laurates%20(NEJM).pdf)
  * [Simpson's Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson's_paradox)
  * [The Book of Why](http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/WHY/) by Judea Pearl, who won the Turing Award for his work on Causality.
    * [A good summary of the key points](https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/goodbye-correlation-say-hello-to-the-era-of-causal-inference-f238065c156b) 
    * [Another good summary](https://bigthink.com/errors-we-live-by/judea-pearls-the-book-of-why-brings-news-of-a-new-science-of-causes)
* Fixating on relative improvements
  * [Scalability! But at what COST?](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/hotos15/hotos15-paper-mcsherry.pdf) [TMP](https://blog.acolyer.org/2015/06/05/scalability-but-at-what-cost/)

### Places to Discuss Research

In Real Life
* [Papers We Love](https://paperswelove.org/)
  * They have a conference too. [PWLConf](https://pwlconf.org/)

On-Line
* [Dist Syst Slack](https://www.the-paper-trail.org/page/dist-sys-slack/)

## Keeping Track of It All

### Techniques

* [Bill Gates on how to remember what you read](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/21/how-bill-gates-remembers-what-he-reads.html)
* Mind mapping

### Tools

Tools are very personal, and actually not the key issue. However, some tools offer some nice features.

* Pen and paper
  * The act of writing and/or drawing is widely reported to improve information retention.
  * Never has an outage (unless you spill your drink on it!)
* Google Docs
  * Collaborative editing
  * Search within your Google Drive account
* Evernote
  * Web clippers from Chrome and Firefox. Will clip PDFs as well as web pages.
  * Premium vertsion OCRs all images (including whole pages in scanned PDFs)
  * Indexes everything. Shows top 3 related items from your personal corpus each time you clip something.
* Papers app
* https://orgmode.org/
  * Simple.
  * Folding plus links is very true to the original spirit of hypertext.
