# Research Resources

A collection of sites, papers and other resources, that we hope will be of use if you are beginning to look at peer-reviewed research.

## Research Discovery

### Research Paper Search and Recommendation Sites

There are a number of websites which index, cross-reference and rank research papers. To get the most out of them, create an account and star/like/follow etc. people and papers you have found insightful or helpful. Then the site will recommend related work to you, often with uncanny accuracy! 

Some of the best:

* https://scholar.google.com
* https://www.semanticscholar.org
* http://www.arxiv-sanity.com/
* https://www.researchgate.net/

### Curated Research Discovery and Discussion

* [Papers We Love](https://paperswelove.org/)
* [The Morning Paper (TMP)](https://blog.acolyer.org/)
* [The Paper Trail](https://www.the-paper-trail.org/)

### Associations and Professional Bodies

* ACM
  * [Preferred Employer Program](https://www.acm.org/membership/preferred-employer) [Current members](https://www.acm.org/membership/preferred-employers-list)
* IEEE
  * Local chapters
* USENIX
  * [Corporate memberships and sponsorships](https://www.usenix.org/supporters)

All of them sponsor and/or run a number of conferences on different areas of computer science.

### Conference Tracking Sites

Deadlines for submission and registration. Rankings, based on different measures of 'impact'.

## Reading and Evaluating Research

### How to Read a Paper

* Will add multiple articles and papers on the subject.

### Decoding and Mining References

There are many different formats for citations and their associated references. Different publication venues have their own style requirements:

* [ACM Citation Style and Reference Formats](https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/reference-formatting)
* IEEE
* USENIX

### Known Dangers and Biases (aka Here Be Dragons)

* Mistaking correlation for causality
  * [Chocolate Consumption, Cognitive Function,
and Nobel Laureates](http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/courses/bio621/misc/Chocolate%20consumption%20cognitive%20function%20and%20nobel%20laurates%20(NEJM).pdf)
  * [Simpson's Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson's_paradox)
  * [The Book of Why](http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/WHY/) by Judea Pearl, who won the Turing Award for his work on Causality.
    * [A good summary of the key points](https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/goodbye-correlation-say-hello-to-the-era-of-causal-inference-f238065c156b) 
    * [Another good summary](https://bigthink.com/errors-we-live-by/judea-pearls-the-book-of-why-brings-news-of-a-new-science-of-causes)
* Fixating on relative improvements
  * [Scalability! But at what COST?](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/hotos15/hotos15-paper-mcsherry.pdf) [TMP](https://blog.acolyer.org/2015/06/05/scalability-but-at-what-cost/)

### Places to Discuss Research

In Real Life
* [Papers We Love](https://paperswelove.org/)
  * They have a conference too. [PWLConf](https://pwlconf.org/)

On-Line
* [Dist Syst Slack](https://www.the-paper-trail.org/page/dist-sys-slack/)

## Keeping Track of It All

### Techniques

* [Bill Gates on how to remember what you read](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/21/how-bill-gates-remembers-what-he-reads.html)
* Mind mapping

### Tools

Tools are very personal, and actually not the key issue. However, some tools offer some nice features.

* Pen and paper
  * The act of writing and/or drawing is widely reported to improve information retention.
  * Never has an outage (unless you spill your drink on it!)
* Google Docs
  * Collaborative editing
  * Search within your Google Drive account
* Evernote
  * Web clippers from Chrome and Firefox. Will clip PDFs as well as web pages.
  * Premium vertsion OCRs all images (including whole pages in scanned PDFs)
  * Indexes everything. Shows top 3 related items from your personal corpus each time you clip something.
* Papers app
* https://orgmode.org/
  * Simple.
  * Folding plus links is very true to the original spirit of hypertext.
